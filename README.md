## Technical Stack

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast API framework that makes building APIs a breeze
- **Python-docx**: Powerful library that handles all the Word document parsing
- **MongoDB**: Reliable database for keeping track of your uploaded files
- **Python 3.x**: The friendly programming language powering it all

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Creates a smooth, interactive user experience
- **Axios**: Handles communication with the backend seamlessly
- **React-JSON-Pretty**: Makes your JSON output beautiful and readable
- **CSS**: Custom styling to make everything look good

### DevOps & Deployment
- **Docker**: Packages everything up so it runs the same way everywhere
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates all the parts working together
- **Nginx**: Efficiently serves the frontend and routes API requests
